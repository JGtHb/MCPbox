## Documentation Guidelines

When adding new documentation:

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Update if project status or architecture changes
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Update for technical design changes
3. **FUTURE-EPICS.md** - Add new feature plans here

Avoid creating new planning documents. Consolidate into existing files.
